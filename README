YouTube Soundboard provides a way to easily save and share clips of YouTube videos.
This repo contains the chrome extension corresponding to this feature.

This extension will inject a script onto all youtube pages.
It allows a simple click on the extension icon, or a right click to start/stop the clip.
The video does not actually have to play: the extension will only record the time of the video.
